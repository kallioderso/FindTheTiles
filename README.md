# 🧩 About Find The Tiles

**Find The Tiles** is a short, memory-based puzzle game. Your goal: uncover a hidden pattern inside a 7x7 grid!  
You start with 2 guaranteed pattern tiles, and must use logic, memory, and the help of upgrades and hints to reveal the rest.  
Every session is different thanks to clever pattern generation.

---

## 🌐 Multiple Languages

Use the language change button to select between 3 languages:
- English (default)
- German
- French

---

# 🧬 Pattern Generation

Find The Tiles uses a custom algorithm for interesting, challenging grid patterns:

- **Random starting point** (favoring the center)
- **Adjacency logic:** Next pattern tile is added with a base 25% chance, reduced based on nearby pattern tiles and edge proximity.
- The result: fun, unpredictable, and fair patterns!

Future plans: neural networks or AI-powered generation for more difficulty.

# 🛍️ Tile-Coins Shop

Instead of XP or levels, you earn **tile-coins** by scoring. Spend coins to buy:
