## üß¨ Pattern Generation

The game uses a custom algorithm to create interesting and challenging patterns:

- A random **starting point** is selected ‚Äî with a higher chance of being near the center.
- Adjacent tiles are added based on a **base 25% chance**, reduced by:
  - Nearby existing pattern tiles (1 = **-0%**, 2 = **-5%**, 3 = **-10%**, 4 = **-15%**)
  - Proximity to the grid‚Äôs outer edges (same as the starting point uses)

This results in clean, well-spread patterns that are fun to uncover and hard to guess.

in the future there will be more difficult Generating methods such as by neural networks or special trained ai (but currently i need to continue learning such methods because i want to keep everything in c#)

## üõçÔ∏è Tile-Coins Shop

Instead of a leveling system, players earn **tile-coins** through scoring.  
These coins will be used to buy upgrades like:
- Extra missclick chances
- Increased difficulty
- Rogue-like modifiers for replayability
- special items (non reusable)

the shop laterly will have a option to buy more different types of level and designs to customise the user experiences
